Hello! 
This is a repository with some exercises following cod√©dex Git & Github Course.

I need to remember these commands!

    git init to create a new local repo.
    git remote add to connect our local and remote repos.
    git add to stage files we made changes to.
    git commit -m '' to ready our files for GitHub (along with a message).
    git push to publish our code changes to our remote repo on GitHub.
